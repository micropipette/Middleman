							<p>As an increasingly growing number of Canadians fall victim to fraudulent schemes every year, it is more important than ever to enhance our fraud prevention efforts in hopes of mitigating cybersecurity breaches that enable fraudulent activities. However, we must first develop a profound understanding of how fraudsters operate and common examples of cases they employ to gain unwarranted access to personal and financial information. Fraudsters often fabricate elaborate stories and scenarios to prove their legitimacy falsely, a few examples of which are outlined below:
								<ul>
									<li>An email/call/message from an individual posing as a Government Official from the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA) indicating one of 2 things:
										<ul>
												<li>Outstanding taxes owed as per a tax audit that was conducted</li>
												<li>You have received money and must open/click on the link provided for the deposit/transaction to occur</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>An email/call/message from an individual posing as a Government Official from the Canadian Immigration Office indicating that your immigration application is yet to be processed due to outstanding fees and or incorrect information provided on official documents.</li>
									<li>An email/call/message from an individual posing as a Bank Teller asking for banking information such as account number, birth date, etc.</li>
									<li>An email/call/message from an individual posing as a Service Canada Representative asking for confidential information such as your Social Insurance Number (SIN) number for the purposes of reactivating/re-issuing it cause it has been compromised/blocked.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>While cases such as the ones outlined above can be intimidating at times as fraudsters often try appealing to the individual’s emotions by creating a sense of urgency, here are a few tips/steps to keep in mind to best deal with scenarios such as these:</p>
							<p><u>THE GOLDEN RULE</u>: If it sounds suspicious, it probably is!
								<ul>
									<li>Refrain from disclosing any personal information, making any financial transactions, and opening any links without official confirmation/documented proof.</li>
									<li>Ask the caller for their employee number/identification and terminate the call soon	after.</li>
									<li>Contact the affiliated organization or company to verify the caller’s identity and to evaluate the legitimacy of the caller’s claims.</li>
									<li>Based on your inquiry block any suspicious phone numbers.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>While these are some general guidelines to follow when faced with these situations, one can understandably make illogical decisions based on impulse and as such here are a few tips/steps to follow in case an unwise/unwanted decision is made:
								<ul>
									<li>If a financial transaction is made or money is transferred to the caller, immediately report it to your financial/banking institution to halt or cancel the transaction.</li>
									<li>If your SIN number is compromised or the caller indicates that it is, immediately contact Service Canada by calling 1-800-206-7218.</li>
									<li>If you are unsure, don’t know how to deal with the situation at hand, and want to report the incident, contact the Peel Regional Police or the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre.</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>While many scams are targeted towards the general public, many scams target the college student population. This is because students this age are more likely to have less possessions to their name as well as tuition and other debts to pay, so they will be more likely to want to make money any way they can. Some common scams targeted towards students include:
								<ul>
									<li>The fake check scam: A scammer will email students pretending to be a professor from your post-secondary institution. They will offer you a part-time job and send you a check to deposit as upfront payment. The only catch is that you have to send a portion of the money to somebody else before keeping the rest. The bank will eventually realize the check is fake and require you to pay the deposit back, but since you gave a portion of the money to somebody else you are no longer able to reclaim that money to pay back to the bank.</li>
									<li>Financial/Scholarship scams: Many companies may rely on high-pressure seminars and pitches to coerce students into accepting “too good to be true” post-secondary grants. The companies will often ask for an advance fee while promising enormous financial aid for the student participating in the scam. Sometimes they will often ask for your checking account for reasons including a weekly or monthly payment, but will go on to debit the account. Some warning signs to watch out for regarding financial aid are claims such as: “you wont get this deal anywhere else”, “scholarship guaranteed or your money back”, and “you’ve won” a contest you never entered or bursary you never applied for.</li>
