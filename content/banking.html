							<h1>Banking and Budgeting</h1>

							<p>A crucial aspect of gaining financial freedom is undoubtedly being able to budget. After all, it does not matter how much money you make unless you know how to spend it. This piece will take you through what a budget is, what the most crucial components of effective budgeting are, and how budgeting can help you achieve financial literacy.</p>
							<h3>What is a Budget?</h3>
							<p>Simply put, a budget is a financial plan that takes into account both your income and expenses, allowing you to plan out how much money you are making and spending in a given amount of time. Budgeting can elucidate areas where you are overspending, and are especially useful when you begin saving money for long-term needs. Furthermore, budgets are also not static, and need to be altered over time to include new expenses and forms of income.</p>
							<h3>What Are The Main Components Of A Budget?</h3>
							<p>Budgets will often vary between individuals in terms of content, but there remain core budget components that are almost completely ubiquitous. Firstly, budgets typically separate expenses into a number of categories, such as fixed and flexible expenses. As the name suggests, fixed expenses are ones which do not vary from month to month or year to year, such as rent payments. Flexible expenses are ones that change from month to month, such as groceries, utilities, or other miscellaneous expenditures. The combination of both fixed and flexible expenses gives total expenses, which is the amount of money you spend in a given time period.</p>
							<p>Income is usually defined as disposable income, which is the remaining money left after income taxes to your monthly or yearly income. Taking these two variables into account, you can examine both your income and expenses, and identify areas where spending can be cut back.</p>
							<h3>How Can Budgeting Improve Your Life?</h3>
							<p>Budgeting is crucial in order to maintain financial freedom, as without it you may quickly find yourself in debt. More importantly, budgeting can also make saving for a long term goal, such as a retirement plan, much simpler because individuals can identify if they are on track to meet such goals, and alter their budgets accordingly if they are unable to do so. Finally, budgeting can also help you save money for unexpected expenses, which would be a welcome cushion for any individual. To get started, a simple format to start budgeting is using an excel spreadsheet, with different columns dedicated to expenses and income. Other websites and apps, like mint and goodbudget allow you to create monthly budgets easily and efficiently.</p>
							<p>All in all, efficient budgeting is crucial for any individual to achieve financial success, and is a simple and effective manner to improve your life.</p>
