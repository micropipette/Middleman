							<h1>Banking and Budgeting (beginner)</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="https://micropipette.github.io/Middleman/images/money.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>A crucial aspect of gaining financial freedom is undoubtedly being able to budget. After all, it does not matter how much money you make unless you know how to spend it. This piece will take you through what a budget is, what the most crucial components of effective budgeting are, and how budgeting can help you achieve financial literacy.</p>
							<h3>What is a Budget?</h3>
							<p>Simply put, a budget is a financial plan that takes into account both your income and expenses, allowing you to plan out how much money you are making and spending in a given amount of time. Budgeting can elucidate areas where you are overspending, and are especially useful when you begin saving money for long-term needs. Furthermore, budgets are also not static, and need to be altered over time to include new expenses and forms of income.</p>
							<h3>What Are The Main Components Of A Budget?</h3>
							<p>Budgets will often vary between individuals in terms of content, but there remain core budget components that are almost completely ubiquitous. Firstly, budgets typically separate expenses into a number of categories, such as fixed and flexible expenses. As the name suggests, fixed expenses are ones which do not vary from month to month or year to year, such as rent payments. Flexible expenses are ones that change from month to month, such as groceries, utilities, or other miscellaneous expenditures. The combination of both fixed and flexible expenses gives total expenses, which is the amount of money you spend in a given time period.</p>
							<p>Income is usually defined as disposable income, which is the remaining money left after income taxes to your monthly or yearly income. Taking these two variables into account, you can examine both your income and expenses, and identify areas where spending can be cut back.</p>
							<h3>How Can Budgeting Improve Your Life?</h3>
							<p>Budgeting is crucial in order to maintain financial freedom, as without it you may quickly find yourself in debt. More importantly, budgeting can also make saving for a long term goal, such as a retirement plan, much simpler because individuals can identify if they are on track to meet such goals, and alter their budgets accordingly if they are unable to do so. Finally, budgeting can also help you save money for unexpected expenses, which would be a welcome cushion for any individual. To get started, a simple format to start budgeting is using an excel spreadsheet, with different columns dedicated to expenses and income. Other websites and apps, like mint and goodbudget allow you to create monthly budgets easily and efficiently.</p>
							<p>All in all, efficient budgeting is crucial for any individual to achieve financial success, and is a simple and effective manner to improve your life.</p>

							</ul>
							<p>Now things get a little more complicated with savings accounts as in Canada they can each be housed in one of three types of tax shelters, each with its own pros and cons. </p>
							<p>For example: You can have a TFSA investing account, an RRSP GIC or a personal Savings account.</p>

							<h2>Tax Shelters</h2>

							<h3>TFSA: Tax Free savings account</h3>
							<p><b>Taxes:</b> Any money you earn in this account goes untaxed. For example: if you buy a stock for $100 and its price appreciates to $200, that profit is entirely yours to keep and the government can’t get their meaty paws on it. </p>
							<p><b>Contribution amount:</b>The amount you can deposit into a TFSA varies depending on when you reach the age of majority in your province as well as the contribution limit set by the government each year.</p>
							<span class="image main"><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/801594943868895264/823620122815758356/tfsalimit.png?width=1440&height=439" alt="" /></span>
							<p>For example: If you turned 18 in Ontario in 2020, you can put up to $12000 into your TFSA accounts. If you turned 18 at or before 2009, you can contribute a total of $75500</p>
							<p>Be careful not to over-contribute to a TFSA as there are heavy penalties for this including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Loss of 12% per year, compounded monthly. For example: If you put an extra $1000 in and left it there for 12 months, you would be charged $126.83 when you file your tax return.</li>
								<li>If the CRA deems that your over-contribution is deliberate and excessive, you may lose TFSA privileges entirely.</li>
							</ul>
							<p><b>Withdrawal:</b> Money you withdraw from a TFSA cannot be contributed back until the next calendar year, unless you have leftover contribution room. </p>
							<p><b>Example:</b> Lets say your contribution limit is 12k and you put 6k into it. If you withdraw that 6k, you can later add it back during the same calendar year without any overcontribution penalty.</p>
							<p><b>Example 2:</b> Lets say your contribution limit is 12k and you put 10k into it. If you withdraw all 10k out, you will only be able to put back 2k that same calendar year. If you put all 10k back in, the CRA will consider that you over-contributed by 8k and you will be penalized accordingly.</p>
							<p><b>Gains/ Losses in a TFSA account:</b> Gains and losses permanently change your TFSA contribution limit.</p>
							<p><b>Example:</b> Lets say your contribution limit is 12k and you bought 8k worth of a stock whose price doubled. This would increase your TFSA contribution limit permanently by 8k even after you have already sold the stock.</p>
							<p><b>Example 2:</b> Lets say your contribution limit is 12k and you bought 10k worth of a stock whose price halved. This would permanently decrease your TFSA contribution limit permanently by 5k even after you have already sold the stock.</p>
							<h3>RRSP: Registered retirement savings plan</h3>
							<p><b>Taxes:</b> 50% of profits you make in a personal account are taxed as income.</p>
							<p>Example: Let's say your annual salary is 40k and you invested 10k in a personal account that doubled to 20k. You would be placed in the same tax bracket of someone with an annual salary of 45k. Keep in mind that with stocks, you will only be taxed on gains after you sell.</p>
							<p><b>Contribution amount:</b> Unlimited. You can put as much as you like in a Personal account. </p>
							<p><b>Withdrawal:</b> Unlimited. You are free to withdraw and reinvest money as you please.</p>
							<p><b>Losses in a Personal account:</b> 100% of losses in a personal account can be deducted from your income, up to 3k/ year.</p>
							<p>For example: Lets say your annual salary is 40k and you invested 10 into a personal account that halved to 5k. You will be placed in the same tax bracket as someone who made 37k.</p>

							<h2>"Ok Great so what Tax shelter should I put my money in?"</h2>
							<p>You should prioritize filling up your TFSA, since any money you make there is never taxed. After that, you can start to put your money in a non-registered/personal account. You should put your money in an RRSP if you expect your income to decrease within the following years.</p>
