							<h1>Credit</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="https://micropipette.github.io/Middleman/images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>In layman’s terms, credit refers to a contractual agreement outlining the amount of money one can borrow, while debt is described as money owed by one party to another. Recognizing that debt can take on many different forms can often pose a challenge for individuals dealing with debt accrued over prolonged periods. As such, it is vital to acknowledge its numerous forms before exploring ways of finding debt relief. The relationship between debt and credit is somewhat unique as one cannot exist with the other — using credit creates debt.</p>
							<p>The various forms of credit can be categorized into two general classifications, including secured and unsecured credit. Secured credit refers to credit backed up by an asset or something of monetary value that the borrower pledges to the lender as “collateral” for the loan. It often involves collateral loan agreements, which give the lender full access and control over the asset in the event that the borrower “defaults” or fails to repay the debt in full accordance with the contract. This may include the foreclosure on a property or the repossession of a car. As collateral requirement lowers the lender’s liability, one may often find it easier to qualify for such credit with arguably better terms than with unsecured credit. Common examples of this form of credit may include secured credit cards, mortgage loans, vehicle loans, etc.</p>
							<p>On the other hand, unsecured credit refers to credit that has not been backed up by an asset or something of monetary value. As the lender, in this case, carries a greater liability, this type of debt customarily carries higher interest rates in comparison to collateralized loans and therefore, qualifying for this form of credit may be more challenging as these loans are solely dependent on the borrower’s creditworthiness. This is one of the reasons why it is important to have a good credit history, which is essentially a record of the borrower’s ability to manage their credit, and timeliness of their payments, sometimes referred to as “instalments”. Common examples of this form of credit may include student loans, personal loans, unsecured credit cards, etc.</p>
							<p>Individuals such as students may have difficulty getting a loan approved all by themselves due to the lack of their borrowing or credit history. Hence, they are most likely required to have someone co-sign their financial agreement to further strengthen their application before they are issued a loan or debt. Individuals co-signing the financial agreement generally have adequate income and a satisfactory credit score. However, they must be willing to accept full financial responsibility in the event that the borrower is unable or unwilling to repay the loan as agreed.</p>
							<p>Maintaining a good credit history is very important, especially as a university student, because lenders will often consider your credit history when predicting how well you will handle credit in the future. Auto dealerships, mortgage lenders and other lending entities may charge a higher interest rate if they see that you have a low credit score and may even reject a loan altogether. In certain cases, employers may be less likely to hire you if your credit score is subpar. Maintaining a good credit score throughout your educational paths will give you an edge when advancing into the job market. Overall, your credit score acts as somewhat of a permanent record of how well you can pay off bills and other expenses. Thus, developing a good credit score during university will put you in a unique and advantageous position in your near future.</p>
							<p>One of the first steps you should consider when applying for a credit card is to check your credit score. This can give you a rough estimate of the level of interest rates you can expect, as well as rewards you may be eligible to receive. The next step would be to research and find a card that best suits your needs, including ongoing rewards or a signup bonus of sorts. Once you have selected the most suitable option, go onto their website and find the application page. Begin by entering your personal information, and submit the application once completed. It typically takes 10 to 14 days for your application to be approved, and once that is done, all there is left to do is activate your card, and you are free to begin spending!</p>
