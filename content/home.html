							<h1>Housing</h1>

							<p>Going into university, many students have never had to think about housing before, and when suddenly faced with finding a place to live it can be incredibly daunting. However, it becomes a lot less intimidating when you familiarize yourself with the jargon and know what to look for.</p>
							<p>In general, students will be looking to rent a place, not to buy simply due to the sheer cost of buying a house - which in it of itself has many pros and cons. Although it may seem that renting a place is inferior to owning a house, the same logic does not apply to renting a movie as does renting a house; renters enjoy benefits such as not having to pay property taxes, avoiding real estate agent fees, cutting on certain home maintenance costs, and no long-term commitment*.</p>
							<p><b>Lease</b>: a contract between the landlord and the tenant, agreeing to provide housing in exchange for paying rent as well as abiding by the agreed-upon terms and conditions. A lease term would be the period in which the lease is in effect for. *The lease term will vary for different landlords and can depend on negotiations, but they are commonly 6,8, or 12 month terms that may or may not be renewable.</p>
							<p>The conditions detailed in the lease contract can include details about:
								<ul>
									<li>Parking only in allocated spaces (or even additional fees for parking)</li>
									<li>Pets (not) allowed</li>
									<li>Not allowing parties or noise past a certain hour</li>
									<li>What sorts of repairs and maintenance the landlord will manage</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p><b>Security Deposits</b> (AKA. “Last month’s rent”): the landlord might ask you to make an initial payment upon moving in that would be used to cover your last month’s rent.</p>
							<p>Landlords will often ask prospective tenants for documents that may or may not include an academic transcript, resume, credit score, police check, and some form of ID. This is mainly to ensure that you are going to be a suitable tenant, and the less risk you appear to pose and the more agreeable you are, the greater the chances that you will secure a lease; landlords do not want rowdy tenants who will damage the property, leading to financial loss for the landlord. In the case of credit score, this may be to determine if the student can in fact keep up with the rent.</p>
							<p>In areas near universities where many students try to find a place to rent, landlords will have multiple prospective tenants lined up, and they may extend the offer based on different factors. Sometimes it is first come first serve, but oftentimes, the landlord will evaluate based on the aforementioned forms of assessing tenants. More often than not, you will find that landlords have a preference for those in graduate studies when compared to an undergraduate student.</p>
							<p>Homes and apartments are not one-size-fits-all, and there are multiple ways to rent. In general, you will find that homes and apartments are either rented to a single person or to a number of individuals. If a home has 4 bedrooms for example, the landlord may rent the house to a single person who then has the ability to sublet to other roommates (this is only possible if the landlord indicates in the lease conditions that subletting is permitted). Alternatively, the landlord may rent the house to multiple separate individuals who do not know each other. Another option would be to approach the landlord with a group of friends or acquaintances, with each person still paying separate rent, however with the benefit of knowing those you share a place with. Usually, the more people in a house, the less individual rent is. However, this does come at the expense of quiet, so keep that in mind if you are someone who cannot concentrate with a lot of noise in the background.</p>
							<p>According to Canada.ca, housing shouldn't cost more than 35% of your monthly income. If you are a student with only a part time job, expect housing to be a higher percentage.</p>
							<p>What to look for in an apartment:
								<ul>
									<li>Included utilities</li>
									<li>Location from transportation</li>
									<li>Amenities</li>
									<li>Stores and other locations in area</li>
									<li>Furnished or not</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>Those are just some of the things to consider when viewing prospective places to rent. The important thing to remember is to always visit or view the place virtually before deciding on a place as pictures listed on websites may be misleading. There may be issues such as water pressure, heating, insects, mold, etc. that may not be apparent without having seen the house live online/in-person. Make sure to ask the landlord any questions or concerns that you may have, no matter how trivial they may seem. Once you have signed the lease there is no going back until after the lease term is over.</p>
							<p>When first moving in, it is very important to thoroughly check the apartment and take initial pictures so they cannot blame you for something that you haven't done.</p>
							<p>Although the process of finding a place, making sure it is the right fit, and moving in is a seemingly arduous process, once you are done you can be proud of yourself for taking another step towards financial and physical independence.</p>
