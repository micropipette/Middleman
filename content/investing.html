							<h3>What is Investing?</h3>
							<p>Investing is the process of buying commodities with the goal of later selling them at a profit. Examples of commodities include:
									<ul>
									<li>Materials such as gold</li>
									<li>Currency </li>
									<li>Real estate </li>
									<li>Equity (i.e. shares of companies)</li>
									<li>Bonds (lending money to a company/government who later repay you with interest)</li>
									</ul>
								This article will mainly focus on equity and bonds since these are the simplest commodities to purchase.</p>

							<h3>How much money do I need to get started?</h3>

							<p>Some accounts have 0 fees so there is no minimum amount to get started. For others, there are management and trading fees so some amount of money is required. For instance, platforms such as TD Ameritrade have a 10 dollar fee on all stock transactions. In future articles, we will share with you some recommendations to explore on your own.</p>

							<h3>Isn't investment risky?</h3>
							<p>It can be if you don’t do the proper preparation. Some people start investing with the goal of getting rich overnight, which results in a success rate similar to winning big at a casino. Instead, we encourage the “set it and forget it” mentality where you put your money and let it grow without you touching it. If you diversify your position, which involves buying commodities in a wide variety of industries, and have a long enough time horizon, this plan will almost certainly earn you a consistent return over the course of years and decades.</p>

							<h3>What should I invest in?</h3>
							<p>We earlier discussed 2 main commodities - stocks and bonds. Stocks provide a higher return but they are much riskier than bonds. How much you invest in each one depends on several factors including:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Age</li>
								<li>Your risk tolerance</li>
								<li>When you plan on needing the money</li>
							</ul>
							<p>If you are interested in a basic guideline behind how much of your income you should be investing in each commodity, we recommend completing the <a href="https://www.vanguardcanada.ca/individual/questionnaire.htm#/">Vanguard Survey</a>, which can be found at the following address:</p>
							<p>You probably previously heard the advice “Don't put all your eggs in one basket” which is an extremely effective way to think about investing. The more you split up your money on different companies, thereby diversifying your portfolio, the lower your risk becomes.</p>
							<p>Picking your own stocks and bonds for your portfolio is no easy task, especially as a beginner. This is why we recommend ETFs (Exchange traded funds). Complicated name aside, think of ETFs as a basket of different stocks picked out by people who actually know what they are doing. Some ETFs (examples linked below) encompass all sectors of the market, whose value is constantly increasing unless there is a recession.</p>
							<p>You can find a simple guideline to effective investment strategies on <a href="https://canadiancouchpotato.com/model-portfolios/Canadian">Canadian Couch Potato</a></p>
							<p>The page provides several portfolios based on your stock/bond allocation preferences. Additionally, many of these portfolios consist of a single ETF that includes both stocks/bonds, which means that you would be buying exactly one commodity and they will do the rest for you.</p>
							<p>
								<ul>
									<li><b>Mutual funds</b>: essentially ETFs provided by banks rather than Investment companies. These usually tend to have higher MERs</li>
									<li><b>MER</b>: Management expense ratio. These are the fees from your profits that are deducted for buying a specific ETF/commodity. These are deducted automatically from your profit.</li>

								</ul>
