							<h1>Taxes</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="https://micropipette.github.io/Middleman/images/taxes.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Taxes is a term that can incite fear in many when brought up, but they are not as complicated as you may think. Instead, a solid understanding of what taxes are, what parts of your income is taxable, and what dates you need to look out for can significantly reduce the strain of tax season.</p>
							<h3>What are Taxes?</h3>
							<p>Put simply, taxes are involuntary fees which are paid by individuals or corporations and enforced by a government entity. This entity can be local, regional, or national, and the money received is then used to fund government activities. These activities can include building infrastructure, financing government programs, or whatever is necessary for the government to keep the country running smoothly.</p>
							<p>The most significant forms of taxes are as follows:
								<ul>
									<li>Income Tax: A percentage of individual earnings filed to the federal government</li>
									<li>Corporate Tax: A percentage of corporate profits taken as tax by the government to fund federal programs</li>
									<li>Sales Tax: Taxes levied on certain goods and services upon their purchase</li>
									<li>Property Tax: Taxes that are based on the value of land and property assets</li>
									<li>Tariffs: Taxes on imported goods imposed in the aim of strengthening internal businesses</li>
									<li>Estate taxes: Taxes applied to the fair market value of property in a person's estate at the time of death</li>
								</ul>
							</p>
							<p>It is worth noting that the tax rates for each of these different forms of income are significantly different from one another, as taxes on certain types of income such as capital gains are significantly lower than an individual’s net income.</p>
							<h3>What are the Deadlines?</h3>
							<p>As of this week, the deadline to file your income tax return remains at April 30, 2021. Self-employed taxpayers (and their spouse or partner) have until June 15, 2021. Previously, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Canadian government offered extensions to file returns for 2019, however those do not appear to be continuing into 2021. One of the most common ways to file your tax returns is online, through the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">Canadian Revenue Agency’s (CRA) services</a>.</p>
